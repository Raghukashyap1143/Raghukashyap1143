# Introduction to ECS (Elastic Container Service)

## Lab Duration : 1hr

## What is AWS ECS used for?:
Amazon ECS offers a fully managed container orchestration solution, streamlining the process for organizations to develop, deploy, and manage containerized applications of any scale on AWS. This can be achieved using either traditional Amazon Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) instances or leveraging serverless computing with AWS Fargate.

## Key Learnings:
In this hands-on lab, you will be learning the following:

* Understanding ***ECS and ECR*** Dashboard and its features
* Creating a container image for use on Amazon ECS
* Pushing docker image to the Amazon ECR repository
* Creating blueprint for your application i.e Task definition
* logical grouping of tasks or services i.e ECS Clusters
